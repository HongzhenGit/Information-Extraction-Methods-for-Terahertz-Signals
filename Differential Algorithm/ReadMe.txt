1) Mathematical Model for Magnetic Signal: 
   Construct in the frequency domain, combined with Debye/Lorentz model.
2) Parameters estimated by Defferential Algorithm
   Number of parameters: Depending on the structure of mediums.
   Number of iterations: Depending on the number of parameters. If there are too many parameters, the optimization might not converge.
